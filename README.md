# DrivePass

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

•	The client is the owner of DrivePass. The system that the DrivePass team wanted to create is an Learning Management System (LMS) to help their clients pass their driving test. DrivePass wants to provide online classes and practice tests and will also provide its customers with on-the-road training.

What did you do particularly well?

• What I did well in this project was plan the structure of the system through the use of different UML diagrams. These diagrams are important because they visualize how the entire system will work together before any development has begun.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

•	The part of my work I would focus on revising is how I defined the functional and non-functional requirements. To improve these sections I would review the transcript with the DrivePass team to ensure that I am meeting all of the clients’ requirements.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

•	The user's needs are important because they understand what their customers’ needs are. In this case, for the DrivePass system, some of their needs were being able to manage and schedule times slots for on-the-road driving instruction and being able to manage the different levels of access users had on the system. Implementing these needs into the design allow me to demonstrate to the DrivePass what success for the system could look like based on the information that have given me.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

•	My approach to designing software is focusing on the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and managing the methodologies, techniques, and tools that help during each phase of the SDLC.
